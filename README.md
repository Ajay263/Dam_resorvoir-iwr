#IWR Water Resources 

### Abstract
IWR Water Resources, a specialized firm in water resources planning and management, faces
significant challenges in ensuring the sustainable supply and preservation of various waterbodies. The
company's objective is to enhance water resource management through precise predictions of water
availability in dams. This project aims to develop robust data solutions that provide accurate
predictions of water levels and flow throughout the year. By creating four distinct mathematical
models tailored to different types of waterbodies, the project seeks to optimize resource allocation,
improve water management strategies, and support the preservation of vital water ecosystems. These
efforts will serve approximately 60 million inhabitants across South Africa, promoting sustainable
water use and management.


### Introduction
IWR Water Resources is a company composed of a team of experienced and highly qualified
hydrologists, water resources planners, and engineers. The company's primary focus is on water
resources planning and management, which includes water resources modeling and model
development. The company faces the challenge of effectively managing water resources to ensure
sustainable supply and preservation of waterbodies. With a strong emphasis on the water sector, this
project aims to develop data solutions to manage water levels in various waterbodies such as springs,
lakes, rivers, aquifers, and dams. By leveraging advanced data analytics and modeling techniques, the
project seeks to provide accurate predictions of water availability, both in terms of level and flow, on
a daily basis throughout the year. This will enable IWR Water Resources to optimize resource
allocation, improve water management strategies, and contribute to the preservation of vital water
ecosystems across South Africa, benefiting approximately 60 million inhabitants.

# Problem Statement
IWR Water Resources, despite having a team of highly skilled professionals, encounters significant
challenges in managing water resources sustainably. The company needs to ensure a continuous and
reliable supply of water while preserving the health of waterbodies. The complexity of water resource
management is heightened by the need to predict water availability accurately in various types of
waterbodies, including springs, lakes, rivers, aquifers, and dams. The absence of precise predictive
models hampers the company's ability to make informed decisions about water allocation, flood
control, irrigation management, and environmental conservation. Thus, there is an urgent need to
develop mathematical models that can accurately predict water levels and flow rates, providing
actionable insights for effective water management.
